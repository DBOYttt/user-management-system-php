# User-menagment-system-php

## Overview

This project is a learning exercise focused on PHP development. It includes various components and examples to help understand and practice PHP programming concepts.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:

- Learn and practice PHP programming.
- Understand the structure and organization of PHP projects.
- Explore different PHP functionalities and libraries.
- Gain hands-on experience with PHP documentation tools like phpDocumentor.

## Features

- **User Management System**: A basic user management system to demonstrate CRUD operations.
- **Database Configuration**: Example classes for database configuration and connection.
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation using phpDocumentor.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: The main programming language used in this project.
- **JavaScript**: For enhancing the user interface and interactivity.
- **phpDocumentor**: For generating project documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DBOYttt/user-management-system-php.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd user-management-system-php
    ```

3. **Set up your environment**:
    - Ensure you have PHP installed.
    - Configure your database settings in the `Dbconfig` section. : to do that open file `class/install/index.html`
    - *if you use program after done dbconfiguration you can just skip all that and open `login.php`*

Here is an explanation of how to become an app administrator:

- To become an app administrator, you must open `programfolder/admin` in your web browser and log in to your admin account.
- To gain an admin account, the user account must be saved in your database with the role `administrator`.

4. **Run the project**:
    - Use a local server like XAMPP or WAMP to run the PHP files.

## Documentation

The project documentation is generated using phpDocumentor. You can view the documentation by opening the `index.html` file in the `doc` directory. (for my personal reasons documentation is in Polish lenguage)
